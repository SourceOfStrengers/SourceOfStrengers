## **🔹 Introduction**
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a **Penetration Tester**, **Backend Developer**, and **Exploit Developer**
passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and secure software development. With years of experience in
cybersecurity and backend development, I have a deep understanding of network security, ethical hacking
methodologies, and secure application development. I specialize in **offensive security**, conducting in-depth
vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and exploit development to secure applications and networks
from real-world threats. My expertise spans across multiple programming languages and security tools, allowing
me to create efficient, scalable, and secure software solutions. I am always eager to contribute to open-source
projects, share security knowledge, and collaborate with other developers and security researchers. Whether it's
**web security**, **API protection**, or **reverse engineering**, I am constantly exploring new techniques to enhance
security and performance.

🚀 My mission is to make the digital world safer, one secure application at a time!
